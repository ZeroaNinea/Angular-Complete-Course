# CypressDocumentationCoreConcepts

This is a project to learn Cypress using Angular with the official [documentatation](https://docs.cypress.io/app/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress). I had problems with dependencies in Angular 19, so I created a new project.

To run this projcet type:

```bash
npm start
```

Or:

```bash
ng s -o
```

To run Cypress type:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```
